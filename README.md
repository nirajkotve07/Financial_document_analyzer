# Financial_document_analyzer
This project is a multi-agent AI system designed to provide a humorous and satirical take on financial analysis. The application, built with FastAPI and CrewAI, simulates a team of highly unqualified financial experts who provide intentionally bad investment advice based on a financial document uploaded by the user.
